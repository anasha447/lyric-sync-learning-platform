## 2026-09-21 — BE-1.1: LrcParser completed

- `[offset:±ms]` applied to every timestamp, clamped at zero
- Repeated timestamps on one line expanded into separate lines
- Lines sorted by start time after expansion
- Empty-text timestamps flagged as instrumental
- `end_ms` derived per line — next line's start, or track duration for the last line
- Enhanced LRC inline word tags stripped from line text
- BOM / CRLF / trailing whitespace handled

## 2026-09-20 — BE-1.1: LrcParser started

- Scaffolded the content-ingestion Spring Boot service (hexagonal: domain/application/adapter/config)
- LrcParser: parses `[mm:ss.xx]` timestamped lines, normalizes tenths/centisecond/millisecond precision to integer ms
- Metadata tags (`[ti:]`, `[ar:]`, `[length:]`) captured into a map instead of being read as lyric lines
